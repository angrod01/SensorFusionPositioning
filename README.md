# SensorFusionPositioning
Indoor positioning system using sensor-fusion for android devices

This project examines the level of accuracy that can be achieved in precision positioning by using built-in sensors 
in an Android smartphone. The project is focused in estimating the position of the phone inside a building where the
GPS signal is bad or unavailable. The approach is sensor-fusion: by using data from the deviceâ€™s different sensors,
such as accelerometer, gyroscope and wireless adapter, the position is determined. The results show that the technique
is promising for future handheld indoor navigation systems that can be used in malls, museums, large office buildings,
hospitals, etc.
